	In the era of data centers, increasingly widespread use of server
 virtualization has been a key leading factor for recognizing the need for
 more flexible and automated switching operations. Increasing use of mobile
 devices (smartphones, tablets and notebooks) also lay an emphasis on
 allocating network resources, responding to rapidly changing resources,
 Quoality of Service (QoS) and security requirements. SDN (Software Defined
 Networking) innovations provide an open, end-to-end, flexible and automated
 ways to tackle these challenges in modern networks. In this assignment, we
 will be focussing only on the security enhancements in a network using
 OpenFlow (a standard for SDN).<br><br>

 You are required to familiarize yourself with Software Defined Networking
 and OpenFlow. The first deliverable for this assignment will be a one page
 summary of your understanding of SDN, potential of network enhancements via
 SDN and challenges that network administrators will face with SDN
 implementations. Then, you should download and install Mininet (openflow
 enabled emulator for SDN that provides openflow network and end-host VMS
 within a single machine). It includes built-in support to create several
 common topologies and allows for the construction of custom topologies
 using a python script. The second deliverable for this assignment will be
 to create an openflow-enabled topology in mininet and provide an
 application that increments the security in a network. For instance, your
 application could reinvent the way rules are created and packets are
 inspected in firewalls; or change the add rules/drop rules in the switches
 for efficient control logic based on run-time network conditions; or
 provide the flexibility to modify traffic prioritization/route preferences
 in openflow switch control logic. As a part of this second deliverable you
 are required to provide a description of your application, topology used,
 how its implemented in networks today, how will openflow improve this
 implementation, what challenges (limitations) might be encountered for your
 proposed openflow enabled implementation and how would your implementation
 behave when the topology scales to include many more hosts. The topology
 for this network can vary for individual submissions. Although in its
 simplest form, it must contain atleast one controller, 4 openflow enabled
 switches and 10 hosts to clearly demonstrate the usage and significance of
 your application.
